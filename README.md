# Windows Automation Toolkit

This project is a beginner-friendly PowerShell toolkit designed to automate common Windows support tasks. It was built as part of my learning journey into IT support and scripting, and reflects real-world scenarios that Level 1 support analysts often handle.

## 🔧 What It Does

The toolkit includes simple scripts for:

- **System Information** – Collects basic hardware and OS details  
- **User Account Creation** – Creates local user accounts with secure passwords  
- **Software Installation** – Installs common apps using Winget  
- **System Health Check** – Checks disk space, services, and update status  
- **Toolkit Menu (Optional)** – Combines all scripts into a single interactive menu

## Scripts Included

- `SystemInfo.ps1`  
- `CreateUser.ps1`  
- `InstallSoftware.ps1`  
- `HealthCheck.ps1`  
- `Toolkit.ps1` (optional menu version)

##  Why I Built This

I created this toolkit to:

- Practice PowerShell scripting  
- Learn how to automate repetitive tasks  
- Improve my understanding of system administration  
- Build a real project I could share with employers and mentors

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Run scripts in PowerShell (some require admin privileges)  
3. Customize as needed for your own environment

> Note: Always test scripts in a safe environment before using in production.

## Learning Outcomes

- PowerShell scripting basics  
- Secure string handling  
- Software deployment with Winget  
- System diagnostics and reporting  
- Error handling and user prompts
